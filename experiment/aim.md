The objective of this experiment is to study the relation between formant frequencies of a vocal tract system and the perception of sounds. This is achieved through construction of a source-system based formant synthesizer. An all-pole filter designed for a given set of formant frequencies is used as the system. The all-pole system is excited with a train of impulses as the excitation source signal constructed using the pitch information.
