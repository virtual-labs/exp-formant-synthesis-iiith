### Procedure

 The experiment section has three vertical bars on the left pane for choosing the formant frequencies. The center pane has a vowel chart shown on the \(F_1-F_2\) plane with the IPA symbols of the vowels shown. The right pane has a vertical bar for choosing the fundamental frequency \(F_0 = \frac{1}{T_0}\). The bottom pane displays the waveform of the vowel synthesized using the above chosen parameters using an all-pole source-system model.

   - Click on the vowel of your choice in the vowel chart in the central pane.

   - Listen to the vowel sound several times by clicking on the play button. Note down the formant frequencies of the vowel. Let \(F_0\) be at 120 Hz (default value).

   - Observe the relationship between the vowel sound perceived and the formant frequencies.

   - Observe the changes in waveform of different vowels.

    Note that the formant space for vowels is a continuum, and not discrete. A new vowel can be synthesized by clicking in between any two known vowels.

   - Synthesize a new vowel by choosing formants frequencies of your choice. Observe how the formant frequencies affect perception.

   - Synthesize vowels for different fundamental frequencies \(F_0\). Observe how the fundamental frequency affects perception.
